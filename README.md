# ocr-for-notes

ocr script for my handwritten notes

## idea of how it works

- take pictures
- put pictures in imgs file
- ocr decodes it
- gpt fixes it
- gpt formats it
- output is a single md file that can be reviewed

To Run:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

To exit:

```bash
deactivate
```
